# Data-Analytics-Gladiator
This is one of the projects assigned to me at my institution. This projected is implemented in 3 phases which are: 


1) Calculating eigen vectors & eigen values. Performing Principal Component Analysis on the IRIS data set. 


2)Plotting the data points after performing Principal Component Analysis. 


3)Using k-nearest neighbour method to predict the accuracy of a species falling into which class.


Enjoy!
