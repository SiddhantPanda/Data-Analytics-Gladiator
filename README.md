This nice small project contains 3 phases which are: 
1) Performing Principal Component Analysis on the IRIS data set. 
2)Plotting the data points after performing Principal Component Analysis. 
3)Using k-nearest neighbour method to predict the accuracy of a species falling into which class.
Enjoy!
